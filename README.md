Easily manipulate a plot using controls like sliders, drop-down lists and date pickers.

There are other packages for doing this, like [manipulate](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/manipulate/versions/1.0.1)
and [manipulateWidget](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/manipulateWidget/vignettes/manipulateWidgets.html). I found that
with `manipulate` I would sometimes run out of space for controls when there were lots of variables; `manipulateWidget` was better 
for this, but for both packages I found the syntax a bit hard to remember, especially during what I found to be the most common use 
cases for manipulating plots, i.e. diagnosing errors and trying out some new code (when I didn't want to be diving into documentation).

`shmanipulate`'s syntax is supposed to be a bit easier to remember. The package only exports one function (also called `shmanipulate`), 
and uses what I find to be a natural "shorthand" syntax for specifying controls for plot manipulation, e.g. `x = c(0, 1)` to control 
the variable `x` using a numeric slider going from 0 to 1, or `y = list("dog", "cat")` to control the variable `y` using a dropdown 
list with two options. The basic syntax looks like this:

``` r
shmanipulate({
   # plotting code goes here...
   }, x = c(0, 1), y = list("dog", "cat")
)
```

`shmanipulate` uses Shiny for plot manipulation, hence the name. If you want more control over plot manipulation, you can pass Shiny 
widgets to the function instead of using the "shorthand" named arguments (see below).

## Installation

You can install `shmanipulate` from GitHub using:

``` r
remotes::install_github("nicholasdavies/shmanipulate")
```

## Quick examples

See `?shmanipulate` for full documentation.

### Specifying controls: the easy way

``` r
shmanipulate( { x = 0:10; plot(A * x^2 + B * x + as.numeric(C), col = if(blue) 4 else 1, main = plot_title, ylim = c(-5, 10)) },
    A = c(0, 0.1), # a slider from 0 to 0.1
    B = 1,         # a numeric text input with starting value 1
    C = list(one = 1, two = 2, three = 3), # a dropdown list with named values
    plot_title = "Example title", # freeform text input
    blue = FALSE                  # checkbox
)
```

### Specifying controls: the flexible way

``` r
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)

shmanipulate({
        dat = data.frame(date = start_date + 0:(n_days - 1),
            value = start_value * exp(0:(n_days - 1) * growth_rate) + rnorm(n_days, 0, noise));
        ggplot(dat) +
            geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value))
    },
    dateInput(inputId = "start_date", label = "Start date", value = "2020-01-01"),
    numericInput(inputId = "start_value", label = "Starting value", value = 1, min = 0, max = 10, step = 1),
    sliderInput(inputId = "growth_rate", label = "Growth rate", min = 0, max = 1, value = 0, step = 0.01),
    numericInput(inputId = "n_days", label = "Number of days", value = 30, min = 1, max = 60, step = 1),
    sliderInput(inputId = "noise", label = "Noise", min = 0, max = 1, value = 0, step = 0.01)
)
```

### Different kinds of numeric sliders

The full syntax for numeric sliders is `c(start_value, min, max, step_size)` where `start_value` and `step_size` are optional. 
This seems like it would create ambiguous cases—since if you provide three values, they could either be `c(start_value, min, max)` 
or `c(min, max, step_size)`—but since `shmanipulate` assumes `start_value >= min` and `min < max`, it's always possible 
for `shmanipulate` to tell which of these two cases is intended.

``` r
shmanipulate({ x = 0:100; plot(A * x^2 + B * x + C, ylim = c(-2000, 2000)) },
    A = c(0.5, 0, 1),         # slider from 0 to 1, with starting value 0.5
    B = c(0, 10, 0.25),       # slider from 0 to 10, with step 0.25
    C = c(0, -1000, 1000, 50) # slider from -1000 to 1000, with starting value 0 and step 50
)
```

### shmanipulate + curve: a delicious pairing

Base R provides the function `curve` to quickly plot the value of a expression over a range of values in a variable `x`.

``` r
shmanipulate(curve(dbeta(x, alpha, beta), 0, 1), alpha = c(1, 100), beta = c(1, 100))
```

### Maybe you like histograms?

This usage can be handy for looking at samples from a posterior distribution.

``` r
data(quakes)
shmanipulate(if (x == y) hist(quakes[[x]], xlab = x) else plot(quakes[[x]], quakes[[y]], xlab = x, ylab = y), 
    x = names(quakes), y = names(quakes))
```
