Easily manipulate a plot using controls like sliders, drop-down lists and date pickers.

There are other packages for doing this, like [**manipulate**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/manipulate/versions/1.0.1)
and [**manipulateWidget**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/manipulateWidget/vignettes/manipulateWidgets.html). I found that
with **manipulate** I would sometimes run out of space for controls when there were lots of variables; **manipulateWidget** was better 
at handling this, but for both packages I found the syntax a bit hard to remember, especially during what I found to be the most common 
use cases for manipulating plots, i.e. diagnosing errors and trying out some new code (when I was normally too distracted to be diving 
into documentation).

**tweak**'s syntax is supposed to be a bit easier to remember than these alternatives. The package has one main function 
(also called `tweak`), and uses what I find to be a natural "shorthand" syntax for specifying controls for plot manipulation, 
e.g. `x = c(0, 1)` to specify the variable `x` using a numeric slider going from 0 to 1, or `y = list("dog", "cat")` to specify the 
variable `y` using a dropdown list with two options. The basic syntax looks like this:

``` r
tweak({
   # plotting code depending on x and y goes here...
   }, x = c(0, 1), y = list("dog", "cat")
)
```

**tweak** uses Shiny for plot manipulation. If you want more control over plot manipulation, you can pass Shiny 
widgets to the function instead of using the "shorthand" named arguments (see below).

## Installation

You can install **tweak** from GitHub using:

``` r
remotes::install_github("nicholasdavies/tweak")
```

## Quick examples

See `?tweak` for full documentation.

### Specifying controls: the easy way

Here's an example of using `tweak` with a few different basic control types.

``` r
tweak( { x = 0:10; plot(A * x^2 + B * x + C, col = if(blue) 4 else 1, main = plot_title, ylim = c(-5, 10)) },
    A = c(0, 0.1), # a slider from 0 to 0.1
    B = 1,         # a numeric text input with starting value 1
    C = list(one = 1, two = 2, three = 3), # a dropdown list with named values
    plot_title = "Example title", # freeform text input
    blue = FALSE                  # checkbox
)
```

This makes a plot of a quadratic equation where the coefficients `A`, `B`, and `C` can be manipulated with different
controls, plus where you can edit the title of the plot and the colour of the points, with the latter two manipulations
being kind of useless but serving to illustrate the kinds of controls supported by **tweak**.

When specifying parameters to manipulate, you can use:
- `x = c(min, max)` for a numeric slider between min and max; you can optionally provide a starting value before min and/or a step value after max (see "Different kinds of numeric sliders" below).
- `y = list(...)` for a fixed set of options in a dropdown menu. If the list has names, these will be shown in the menu; otherwise, the list values converted to character are shown. The first element is selected by default. For convenience, a vector of strings (e.g. `c("one", "two")`) will also be interpreted as a dropdown menu, so long as it has more than one element. 
- `z = TRUE` or `z = FALSE` for a logical value controlled by a checkbox.
- `foo = "Some text"` for a character string controlled by text input.
- `bar = 123.456` for a numeric value controlled by text input.
- `baz = as.Date("2020-01-01")` for a Date object with a calendar input.

### Specifying controls: the flexible way

If you want complete control over how controls are displayed, you can pass Shiny widgets as unnamed arguments to
`tweak`, with the `inputId` parameter specifying the variable name within the plot expression. This lets you
do things you can't do with the shorthand syntax, like setting a label for the widget which differs from the
variable name, using the `label` argument. This might be useful if you're really familiar with Shiny syntax. 
Personally, though, I wouldn't bother.

``` r
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)

tweak({
        dat = data.frame(date = start_date + 0:(n_days - 1),
            value = start_value * exp(0:(n_days - 1) * growth_rate) + rnorm(n_days, 0, noise));
        ggplot(dat) +
            geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value))
    },
    dateInput(inputId = "start_date", label = "Start date", value = "2020-01-01"),
    numericInput(inputId = "start_value", label = "Starting value", value = 1, min = 0, max = 10, step = 1),
    sliderInput(inputId = "growth_rate", label = "Growth rate", min = 0, max = 1, value = 0, step = 0.01),
    numericInput(inputId = "n_days", label = "Number of days", value = 30, min = 1, max = 60, step = 1),
    sliderInput(inputId = "noise", label = "Noise", min = 0, max = 1, value = 0, step = 0.01)
)
```

### Different kinds of numeric sliders

The full syntax for numeric sliders is `c(start_value, min, max, step_size)` where `start_value` and `step_size` are optional. 
This seems like it would create ambiguous casesâ€”since if you provide three values, they could either be `c(start_value, min, max)` 
or `c(min, max, step_size)`â€”but because `tweak` assumes `start_value >= min` and `min < max`, it's always possible 
for `tweak` to tell which of these two cases is intended.

``` r
tweak({ x = 0:100; plot(A * x^2 + B * x + C, ylim = c(-2000, 2000)) },
    A = c(0.5, 0, 1),         # slider from 0 to 1, with starting value 0.5
    B = c(0, 10, 0.25),       # slider from 0 to 10, with step size 0.25
    C = c(0, -1000, 1000, 50) # slider from -1000 to 1000, with starting value 0 and step size 50
)
```

### tweak + curve: a delicious pairing

Base R provides the function `curve` to quickly plot the value of an expression over a range of values in a variable `x`.
This can be paired with `tweak` for a quick way of familiarising yourself with how a function behaves.

``` r
tweak(curve(dbeta(x, alpha, beta), 0, 1), alpha = c(1, 100), beta = c(1, 100))
```

### Maybe you like histograms?

The following usage can be handy for looking at samples from a posterior distribution.

``` r
data(quakes)
tweak(if (x == y) hist(quakes[[x]], xlab = x) else plot(quakes[[x]], quakes[[y]], xlab = x, ylab = y), 
    x = names(quakes), y = names(quakes))
```
